# Step one: choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday
I picked the following image from MakeOverMonday repository. I picked this chart because the content in the chart is of personal interest to me and several people I know. Most students are on a tight budget and cannot spend exorbitant amounts on high protein foods. It was also interesting because most of the food items they showed on the chart are food items that I consume on a regular basis. Hence, I was able to relate better to the content of the chart and also learn how much the cost varies between them so I can make more pocket friendly decisions.

# Step two: critique the data visualization

What visualization are you ranking?  Provide the title and web-accessible URL.

_The Cheapest Ways to Get Your Protein_


**Usefulness**.  Is it useful for the intended audience?  Does it communicate valuable information? 1-10
8
It is pretty useful for the intended audience which could be fitness enthusiasts, nutritionists, dieticians etc. It is common knowledge that healthy food is not budget friendly and the chart helps understand which sources of protein are more pocket friendly compared to others. The visualization does a good job in conveying this useful information but there are pieces of information on the chart which are harder to comprehend and add to clutter, hence I did not rate it any higher than a 8/10.

**Completeness**.  Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable? 1-10
9
The visualization has everything the viewer needs to understand the chart. For instance, the title gives enough context to understand what the viz is about and the axis titles help understand the variables. It is a fairly straightforward bar chart and does not have much cognitive overload for the viewers. 

**Perceptibility**.  Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate?  Does it use illogical comparisons? 1-10
6
It is very easy to understand the bar chart and the associated cost information it tries to display. However, the calorie data label added to the bars make it difficult to read because taller bars have smaller calorie count compared to other shorter bars. There could have been a better way to visualize the calorie information making it easier to perceive. 

**Truthfulness**.  Is the visualization accurate, reliable and valid?  Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisons that aren't correct? 1-10
7
The visualization definitely represents what it intends to do, which is showing which source of protein costs the least per 30 grams of protein. It doesn’t misinterpret the data but it doesn’t showcase the whole picture. For example, even though Whey Protein is the second cheapest protein choice as it costs less, its cost per package is extremely high so the user is paying a higher price upfront.

**Intuitiveness**. Is it easy to understand and clearly communicate the information?  If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on how to interpret it? 1-10
7
The bar chart is easy to understand with the price value as the height of the bars. However, when we look at the calorie information, it gets confusing because some taller bars have lower calorie count than other shorter bars. This makes the bar less intuitive.

**Aesthetics**.  Is it interesting / enjoyable to look at?  Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like?  Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at? 1-10
7
The bar chart in itself is interesting to look at. However, some of the aesthetic elements that the designer added failed to come through to the viewer. For example, the icons added on top of the bars are supposed to add aesthetic value and context but they are difficult to read and forces the viewer to squint / zoom in. 

**Engagement**.  Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic?  Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others? 1-10
8
The chart gives some information about the cost and protein intake which would be of interest to the primary audience of this visualization. However, it does not give a complete picture of the food intake because there are several other variables like fat, sugar, carbohydrate intake in these food items that can affect the food choices. I do agree that just looking at the cheapest protein options was new information to me and made me want to talk about it to my friends who would find this information useful.   

Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?  
The simplicity of a bar chart clearly telling me which are the cheaper options and which are the more expensive ones worked really well. It took me almost no time to understand the context of the chart and get to this conclusion. I felt like adding the pictures on top of each bar was a good idea but did not quite work well because most of those images were hard to read. I would try to incorporate the calorie info better into the viz and also include other information like cost per package of each item because essentially that is the price the user pays upfront. Also, with respect to the color choice of the bars, since the value we are measuring is the cost (in $), I would rather use a green color because that usually resonates with money better than blue. 

Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?
Nutritionists, Dieticians and fitness enthusiasts are some prospective viewers for this visualization. The visualization is effective for this audience because it is a very simple visualization and the audience is fairly educated to grasp the key elements of this visualization. However, this audience would like to have some other additional information like total package price, calorie count and other information like fat, sugar content etc before making the conclusion that a certain food item is the cheapest source of protein and recommending it.

Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)
I feel like this method is definitely very comprehensive in its approach to cover all aspects of the visualization. I had to spend a lot of time trying to dig into the details of the graph and think about finer things which I might have skipped over without the structure that this method provides. However, I felt like there was some overlap between the different metrics it tried to capture like Perceptibility and Intuitiveness. I found that much of the points around these metrics were the same and having two separate metrics did not provide any additional value. I would have liked if the method also captured details on color and chart type choices. This is because I often spend a good chunk of my designing time trying to figure out the best choices for these and they lay the foundation of the visualization.
