# Step one: choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday
I picked the following image from MakeOverMonday repository. I picked this chart because the content in the chart is of personal interest to me and several people I know. Most students are on a tight budget and cannot spend exorbitant amounts on high protein foods. It was also interesting because most of the food items they showed on the chart are food items that I consume on a regular basis. Hence, I was able to relate better to the content of the chart and also learn how much the cost varies between them so I can make more pocket friendly decisions.
