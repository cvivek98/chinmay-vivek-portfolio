# Wireframes / storyboards

I started with refining my topic a bit and narrowing it down to just mental health impact. When I started playing with the data, I came up with new visualisations that I did not think of while working on part 1. Also, before building the charts, I had to do a lot of data cleaning for some of the data sources. The data was just not in the right format or I had to clean it up for making things easier in Tableau. In addition, I had to merge the data from three different CSV files for the public survey data because that is how it was available online. However, since some of the metrics were key in this data source, I decided to spend the efforts in cleaning and merging the data sources now to make things simpler during part 3.

# User research 


## Target audience
Target audience is essentially policy makers in the US who are in power/position to make policies around Health Equity and COVID relief.


## Interview script

1. What stood out after going through the whole story? Any specific emotions that sparked as you went through it?

3. How did you perceive the flow of the story? Did it effectively convey the message and engage with you throughout?

4. Were there any data visualizations or infographics in the story that effectively communicated the magnitude of mental health disparities among minority groups? 

5. As a member of the target audience (policy makers) for this story, do you feel empowered or inspired to take action or advocate for change in addressing mental health inequities? What additional resources or calls to action would you find helpful in driving momentum for policy reform?

## Interview findings

1. What stood out after going through the whole story? Any specific emotions that sparked as you went through it?
<br>**Interviewee A**: Being a part of a minority group, I could connect to your story. I was sad to know that even in grave situations like the pandemic, there was rampant distress and discrimination.
<br>**Interviewee B**: Perhaps with more pictures of facial expressions, I would have felt more emotional.
<br>**Interviewee C**: I liked the fact that the conflict was nicely structure and how the story led me to it because I kept asking "Why??"

2. How effectively does the story highlight the unique mental health challenges faced by minority communities during the COVID-19 pandemic? Are there specific examples or narratives that resonated with you?
<br>**Interviewee A**: The sections are very specific, and highlight various aspects that sum up the mental health challenges faced by minority communities.
<br>**Interviewee B**: I liked the graph with green colors that highlighted the important of engage with other people. Deployed by ethnicity. Perhaps, you cold join that view with a picture of two people from different races, talking. 
<br>**Interviewee C**: It was clear to me that I am a policy maker and these are all the issues in the society that need to be fixed. I liked how you bring up the health insurance / income charts because as soon as I saw that I could tell this is the climax of the story.

3. How did you perceive the flow of the story? Did it effectively convey the message and engage with you throughout?
<br>Interviewee A: The story was well structured, with a smooth flow. I would have loved the blue color for the bar graphs. Also, I had to wait till the end to know the reasons for the various challenges.
<br>**Interviewee B**: Yes
<br>**Interviewee C**: I really liked the narrative structure. But, the setup was longer than I would like it to be. I got the point of minority vs white numbers with the first couple of charts itself so I was waiting for the "why" for a long time.

4. Were there any data visualizations or infographics in the story that effectively communicated the magnitude of mental health disparities among minority groups? 
<br>**Interviewee A**: All your visualizations were clear and concise and contrasted the magnitude of people from different minority communities. I believe real images and graphs would attract more attention from policymakers.
<br>**Interviewee B**: I really like the  the graph with green colors that highlighted the important of engage with other people... also the one with the death count. 

In the graph "Psychological Distress" there is a rating with values from 6 to 9.6, but you don't clarify what does it mean?
I also don't understand the Average Perceived Discrimination rates, from 10.5 to 17.7

In the "Mortality Rate by Ethnicity" graph, why is the White race not mentioned, if it was mentioned in all the above graphs, and even with a different color to highlight it.


The "Average Health Insurance %" donut graph is very even, what are you trying to show, because if it looking almost the same information, perhaps you can either use a different viz, or not show it, unless you want to make a point in your story with this graph. 

with this changes the story can be better explained.

<br>**Interviewee C**: I liked all the visualisation, they were all clear and clean. However, I would make their size smaller so that they fit in one screen. I had to scroll multiple times to see the whole chart. Also I would reduce the number of rows - I don't think you need to tease out every single race / ethnic group. 

5. As a member of the target audience (policy makers) for this story, do you feel empowered or inspired to take action or advocate for change in addressing mental health inequities? What additional resources or calls to action would you find helpful in driving momentum for policy reform?
**Interviewee A**: I definitely feel empowered to take action and advocate for change in addressing the issue. I believe it is not only the task of the government to take measures against the challenges. Every individual in the community has to address this issue and rise above hate and discrimination.
**Interviewee B**: It is a good story, i woudnt change anything else
<br>**Interviewee C**: Yes, I was moved by the story and motivated to take action. I also liked the fact that the story was very unique because when people talk about COVID, they don't think about the mental health implications it could have caused. So it was interesting to see all the data points.

# Identified changes for Part III

Insight: The audience could connect to the story but it still did not feel very personal to them.
<br>Change: I had a lot of cartoons to reinforce the emotions but I will now replace some of them with real pictures of people who were affected. For e.g. a picture of a racial minority member who was impacted by COVID looking right at the viewer would be more impactful.
<br>
<br>Insight: The audience liked the graphs but it was still a lot to interpret.
<br>Change: I would do a few changes here. I will try to play around and club all minorities together to show white vs minority in a single snapshot. This would also solve the problem of charts being too big and information overlaod for the viewers. In addition, I would add real life pictures next to some of the charts to visually aid the user in feeling the intended emotion. For e.g. one interviewee gave an example of adding two racial minority indivduals talk to each other next to the chart which shows decline in neighbor interactions and isolation.

<br>Insight: It took a long time to get to the "Why"
<br>Change: I will take out some of the charts in my setup because most of them re-iterating the same point. I think I can achieve the same impact with fewer charts. Also, I want the users to reach to the "why" earlier before they lose interest or start forgetting the first few insights.

<br>Insight: Some charts are not intuitive unless you read into them 
<br>Change: I need to add units / labels for some of the charts because they are not all intuitive.
