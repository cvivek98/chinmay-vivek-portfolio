# Wireframes / storyboards

I started with refining my topic a bit and narrowing it down to just mental health impact. When I started playing with the data, I came up with new visualisations that I did not think of while working on part 1. Also, before building the charts, I had to do a lot of data cleaning for some of the data sources. The data was just not in the right format or I had to clean it up for making things easier in Tableau. In addition, I had to merge the data from three different CSV files for the public survey data because that is how it was available online. However, since some of the metrics were key in this data source, I decided to spend the efforts in cleaning and merging the data sources now to make things simpler during part 3.

## Interview findings

1. What stood out after going through the whole story? Any specific emotions that sparked as you went through it?
Interviewee A: Being a part of a minority group, I could connect to your story. I was sad to know that even in grave situations like the pandemic, there was rampant distress and discrimination.
Interviewee B: Perhaps with more pictures of facial expressions, I would have felt more emotional.
Interviewee C:

2. How effectively does the story highlight the unique mental health challenges faced by minority communities during the COVID-19 pandemic? Are there specific examples or narratives that resonated with you?
Interviewee A: The sections are very specific, and highlight various aspects that sum up the mental health challenges faced by minority communities.
Interviewee B: I liked the graph with green colors that highlighted the important of engage with other people. Deployed by ethnicity. Perhaps, you cold join that view with a picture of two people from different races, talking. 
Interviewee C: 

3. How did you perceive the flow of the story? Did it effectively convey the message and engage with you throughout?
Interviewee A: The story was well structured, with a smooth flow. I would have loved the blue color for the bar graphs. Also, I had to wait till the end to know the reasons for the various challenges.
Interviewee B: Yes
Interviewee C:

4. Were there any data visualizations or infographics in the story that effectively communicated the magnitude of mental health disparities among minority groups? 
Interviewee A: All your visualizations were clear and concise and contrasted the magnitude of people from different minority communities. I believe real images and graphs would attract more attention from policymakers.
Interviewee B: I really like the  the graph with green colors that highlighted the important of engage with other people... also the one with the death count.

In the graph "Psychological Distress" there is a rating with values from 6 to 9.6, but you don't clarify what does it mean?
I also don't understand the Average Perceived Discrimination rates, from 10.5 to 17.7

In the "Mortality Rate by Ethnicity" graph, why is the White race not mentioned, if it was mentioned in all the above graphs, and even with a different color to highlight it.


The "Average Health Insurance %" donut graph is very even, what are you trying to show, because if it looking almost the same information, perhaps you can either use a different viz, or not show it, unless you want to make a point in your story with this graph. 

with this changes the story can be better explained.

Interviewee C:

5. As a member of the target audience (policy makers) for this story, do you feel empowered or inspired to take action or advocate for change in addressing mental health inequities? What additional resources or calls to action would you find helpful in driving momentum for policy reform?
Interviewee A: I definitely feel empowered to take action and advocate for change in addressing the issue. I believe it is not only the task of the government to take measures against the challenges. Every individual in the community has to address this issue and rise above hate and discrimination.
Interviewee B: It is a good story, i woudnt change anything else
Interviewee C:
