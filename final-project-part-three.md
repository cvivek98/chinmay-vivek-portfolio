# Changes made since Part II
Of course, here's a more detailed version of the text regarding the changes made between part 2 and part 3 of your visual website assignment:

To refine my visual website between parts 2 and 3 of the assignment, I initiated a comprehensive review process, beginning with a thorough examination of feedback received from part 2. Recognizing the need for a cohesive narrative, I arranged an in-person meeting with my professor to gain further insights into the perceived gaps within my story. During this meeting, we pinpointed several areas requiring improvement, prompting me to seek additional perspectives.

In order to gather diverse feedback, I conducted interviews with three individuals who were deliberately provided with no prior context about the project. Their task was to critically evaluate the narrative's effectiveness as a standalone piece and its resonance with the intended audience. Their insights echoed the professor's feedback, highlighting areas where the narrative fell short and suggesting potential avenues for enhancement.

As a result of this feedback, I embarked on significant revisions to the narrative structure. One notable adjustment involved reordering the sequence of slides, with a heightened emphasis on establishing the "why" aspect early on. Recognizing the importance of expeditiously conveying the core message, I prioritized the presentation of socioeconomic disparities as the foundational premise, followed by a detailed exploration of social and economic inequalities.

Furthermore, I meticulously scrutinized governmental interventions, particularly the efforts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in addressing the identified disparities. This scrutiny culminated in the inclusion of a poignant screenshot from the Minority Mental Health Awareness Month website, symbolizing institutional shortcomings and underscoring the urgency for reform.

In parallel, I endeavored to augment the actionable components of the narrative, conducting extensive research to identify tangible policy measures capable of effecting meaningful change. Through this research, I identified the Medicaid program as a potential avenue for immediate relief, albeit with limitations in mental health coverage. In response, I proposed nuanced adjustments to Medicaid, advocating for both mandatory and optional coverage expansions tailored to mitigate mental health disparities among minority populations.

In addition to narrative enhancements, I refined the visualizations presented on the website. This involved adding unit labels and axis descriptions to charts to enhance viewer comprehension. Furthermore, I removed extraneous charts deemed tangential to the narrative, ensuring that each visual element contributed meaningfully to the overarching message without causing confusion.

By iteratively refining both the narrative and visual components of the website, I aimed to present a compelling and coherent story that not only identifies systemic disparities but also offers actionable pathways toward equitable change.
