# Changes made since Part II
Of course, here's a more detailed version of the text regarding the changes made between part 2 and part 3 of your visual website assignment:

To refine my visual website between parts 2 and 3 of the assignment, I initiated a comprehensive review process, beginning with a thorough examination of feedback received from part 2. Recognizing the need for a cohesive narrative, I arranged an in-person meeting with my professor to gain further insights into the perceived gaps within my story. During this meeting, we pinpointed several areas requiring improvement, prompting me to seek additional perspectives.

In order to gather diverse feedback, I conducted interviews with three individuals who were deliberately provided with no prior context about the project. Their task was to critically evaluate the narrative's effectiveness as a standalone piece and its resonance with the intended audience. Their insights echoed the professor's feedback, highlighting areas where the narrative fell short and suggesting potential avenues for enhancement.

As a result of this feedback, I embarked on significant revisions to the narrative structure. One notable adjustment involved reordering the sequence of slides, with a heightened emphasis on establishing the "why" aspect early on. Recognizing the importance of expeditiously conveying the core message, I prioritized the presentation of socioeconomic disparities as the foundational premise, followed by a detailed exploration of social and economic inequalities.

Furthermore, I meticulously scrutinized governmental interventions, particularly the efforts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in addressing the identified disparities. This scrutiny culminated in the inclusion of a poignant screenshot from the Minority Mental Health Awareness Month website, symbolizing institutional shortcomings and underscoring the urgency for reform.

In parallel, I endeavored to augment the actionable components of the narrative, conducting extensive research to identify tangible policy measures capable of effecting meaningful change. Through this research, I identified the Medicaid program as a potential avenue for immediate relief, albeit with limitations in mental health coverage. In response, I proposed nuanced adjustments to Medicaid, advocating for both mandatory and optional coverage expansions tailored to mitigate mental health disparities among minority populations.

In addition to narrative enhancements, I refined the visualizations presented on the website. This involved adding unit labels and axis descriptions to charts to enhance viewer comprehension. Furthermore, I removed extraneous charts deemed tangential to the narrative, ensuring that each visual element contributed meaningfully to the overarching message without causing confusion.

By iteratively refining both the narrative and visual components of the website, I aimed to present a compelling and coherent story that not only identifies systemic disparities but also offers actionable pathways toward equitable change. 

## The audience
Before proceeding to part 3, my call to action primarily focused on advocating for mental health programs aimed at achieving health equity among policy makers, who constituted the target audience. However, following extensive discussions with my professor and conducting three additional interviews, I decided to refine this call to action significantly. The insights gained from these conversations prompted me to propose specific changes to certain coverage requirements within the Medicaid program, thereby making my call to action more actionable and providing it with a clearer direction.

Throughout the process, my target audience remained policy makers, a fact that was consistently reaffirmed in both the initial and subsequent interviews. However, with the introduction of healthcare policies and the proposed Medicaid program modifications, my intention shifted towards targeting a specific subset of policy makersâ€”namely, those in positions of influence and authority capable of effecting changes to the Medicaid program. This strategic adjustment allowed me to tailor my message more precisely, focusing on engaging individuals with the power to enact tangible policy reforms in support of mental health equity.

# Final thoughts
Engaging in this project was a deeply enriching experience for me, as it perfectly balanced challenge and enjoyment. With a professional background in data visualization, I've always found immense satisfaction in this field. However, this particular project pushed me to explore beyond just visualizing data; it compelled me to delve into the intricate realm of narrative structure and storytelling. Initially, I approached the project following the conventional setup, conflict, and resolution framework, as taught in our course materials. Yet, I soon realized that the story didn't resonate as clearly with the audience as it did in my mind. This realization prompted multiple iterations and adjustments, including conducting additional interviews and experimenting with various sequence versions to refine the narrative and ensure that key insights were effectively communicated to viewers.

As the presentation deadline loomed, I faced the challenge of condensing our findings into a concise format suitable for a one-minute presentation. Crafting impactful slides within this tight timeframe proved to be a significant endeavor. While storytelling thrives with ample time and space, condensing it to a mere minute posed a unique set of challenges. Nonetheless, through meticulous selection and refinement, I ultimately achieved a presentation that encapsulated the essence of our narrative effectively.

A crucial lesson I gleaned from this experience was the importance of gauging audience perception. As a designer, my perspective on the story may differ significantly from that of the viewers. Thus, soliciting feedback from diverse individuals allowed me to gain invaluable insights into how the story resonated with different audiences, facilitating further refinement and enhancement. Overall, while the journey presented its share of challenges, witnessing the culmination of our efforts in a compelling narrative was immensely gratifying.
