# Changes made since Part II
After meticulously reviewing the feedback from part 2 of the assignment and engaging in a productive in-person meeting with my professor, it became apparent that my narrative needed refinement to effectively convey the intended message. To bridge the gaps in my storytelling, I sought additional perspectives by conducting interviews with three individuals who were provided no prior context about the story, encouraging them to critically assess the narrative's coherence and its resonance with the target audience. Their insights echoed the professor's feedback, prompting significant adjustments to enhance the narrative's clarity and impact.

One notable change involved reordering the slides, prioritizing the "why" aspect as the introductory slide based on feedback indicating a desire for quicker access to the core message. Subsequently, I strategically structured the narrative flow to highlight socioeconomic disparities as the root cause, followed by sections addressing social and economic inequalities. By establishing the narrative groundwork early on, I then transitioned to governmental interventions, scrutinizing the CDC's efforts through a critical lens, symbolized by the inclusion of a non-functional screenshot from the Minority Mental Health Awareness Month website to underscore institutional shortcomings.

Furthermore, recognizing the importance of actionable calls to action, I delved deeper into research to identify tangible policy measures capable of addressing the issue. Through this exploration, I identified the Medicaid program as a viable avenue for immediate relief, albeit with limitations concerning mental health coverage. To address this gap, I proposed nuanced adjustments to Medicaid, advocating for both mandatory and optional coverage expansions tailored to mitigate mental health disparities among minority populations.

In tandem with narrative revisions, I refined the visualizations by incorporating clear unit labels and axis descriptions, facilitating viewer comprehension. Additionally, I streamlined the content by removing complex charts deemed tangential to the narrative, ensuring that each visual element contributed meaningfully to the overarching message without causing confusion or detracting from the story's coherence. Through these iterative enhancements, my visual website now presents a compelling narrative that not only identifies systemic disparities but also offers actionable pathways towards equitable change.
