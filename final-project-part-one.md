# Outline

The idea of my project is to showcase the impact of COVID on different segments of our scoiety. The impact here would encompass more than just the health related implications. It will include personal implications like education, mental well being etc. This topic peaked my interest because COVID was a biological disease which should have impacted everyone equally but because of the way our society is structured, it affected some segments of society significantly more than others. I came across some reports around this topic for another class last year and it made me think about the impacts COVID has had on our society apart from the health impacts. We often do not think about these implications but they play a crucial role in how we perceive and contribute to our society on a daily basis. Shedding light on these issues and making the viewers think about them is the primary objective of my project.

The audience of this project would be all kinds of people. From students to policy-makers, everyone has been impacted by COVID in the past few years and bringing attention to this side of the implications of COVID would be of interest to everyone. The data is going to primarily focus on US geographies but potentially also showcase a couple of other countries to demonstrate paralells in impact across the globe. I intend to start with showcasing a generic vaccination chart and then segmenting it by race / ethnicity to demonstrate how some segments of society were left behind in the race of vaccination. After estabilishing that there was an apparant difference in resource allocation for some segments of the society, I plan to showcase the impact caaused by these differences vaccinations. Some of these metrics could be casualty metrics like hospitalisation, death rates etc. but I can also add other metrics to showcase other kinds of impact that most people haven't paid too much attention to.  

As the user navigates throught the story, this is an approximate how the emotional journey will look like leaving the user with astonishment and curiosity to learn more about this topic:

## Initial sketches


1. The first graph showcases the difference in vaccination rates to highlight the difference based on ethnicity. This is the disparity that takes place because of the way our society is strucutured.

2. The bottom left graph shows the risk of death of different ethnicities compared to white participants be benchmarking the risk against white participants.

3. The top right graph now shows the consequences of this disparity by demonstrating impact on mental health of white participants compared to BAME participants.

4. The bottom right graph showcases how BAME participants lost jobs a lot faster further worsening their situation in battling COVID.

# The data

I found the following data sources that will be build the story:

2021/W28: UK COVID Vaccination Coverage by Age & Ethnicity:

https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w28


This data source provide data which compares vaccination rates of BAME group with white ethnicity participants. I plan to use line charts to demonstrate the apparant difference in vaccination rates between white ethnicity participants compared to BAME participants. This will help me introduce the foundation of disparity in vaccination rates based on ethnicity to lead my viewers upto the consequences of these differences.

2021/W29: UK COVID-19 Mortality Rate by Ethnicity:

https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w29

This data source provides with data that correlates mortality with ethnicity. It also demonstrates the higher risk of being part different of certain ethnicity compared to other ethnicities. It normalizes the death risk of BAME groups (Black, Asian & Minority Ethnic) compared to White participants. I plan to use compare these ethnicities in a bar chart or an abacus chart to highlight the differences.  


COVID Impact Survey - Public Data

https://data.world/associatedpress/covid-impact-survey-public-data

This data source provides data of a public survey which captures details about physical health, mental health, economic security and social dynamics related to the coronavirus pandemic in the US. I plan to use some of the metrics here to showcase the lesser known impact that these disparities have had on some groups of society. The goal is to leave the user with an eye-opening perception of the larger impacts COVID has had on our society and how no one talks about it. 


# Method and medium
I plan to use Shorthand and Tableau to incorporate several different interactive visualisations and convey a cohesive story around the impact of covid based on race/ethnicity/income etc. Most of the data sources are csv files so they are fairly straight forward to load into Tableau, create an extract and start building charts. I want the Tableau charts to demonstrate the key pieces of my story with powerful visualizations and then Shorthand to put together these pieces together and weave a cohesive narrative that the user finds seamless and intriguing.
